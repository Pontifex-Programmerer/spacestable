# spacestable
Penguins herd ponies, and now its your job to collect spaceponies for your stable.
Space ponies are hidden across realms in the virtual universe hidden behind the vortex.

Instruction for building your own stable environment for spaceponies
1. Make sure to give the unstable template a bath in your very own pool!
2. You should be able to access your newly deployed stable by taking on your hacker-alias
3. It is not necessary to ride a turtle to get in, but it sure helps to wear a secure shell!
4. From hereon and out! Pay attention to details!
